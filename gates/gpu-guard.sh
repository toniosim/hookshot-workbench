#!/bin/bash
# The harness's guard for the RTX 4090, which is also the user's desktop. One instance runs while anything of the
# harness may use the card (nx2navi-gpu-slot starts it). It does two things.
#
# 1. A driver fault ends every harness run at once and closes the card. On 2026-11-10 at 12:08:48 the kernel logged
#    "NVRM: Xid ... 8" on a harness game; the game and a test program went on for another half minute, the driver's
#    watchdog reported the GPU locked, and Hyprland crashed into safe mode with every window the user had open. At the
#    first such kernel line this guard kills every harness process that has the card open (SIGKILL: a hung client does
#    not answer anything else), writes the file "closed" into the slot folder, which makes both gates refuse until the
#    main session removes it, writes what it saw to reports/GUARD-TRIPPED.txt and reports/LOG.md, and writes 1 into
#    the user's switch /home/mooki/Games/.hookshot-harness/gpu-slots (the gate then lets one game in at a time, not
#    two, until someone writes 2 again).
#
# 2. Nothing of the harness uses the card outside the gate. The likeliest cause of that crash was a test program built
#    in /tmp and run beside a game without the gate. Every second the guard looks at each process of this user
#    that has an NVIDIA device node open: one whose executable lies in a harness game copy (NX2navi's .nx2navi-*,
#    Hookshot's .hookshot-h-*), a worktree or clone (NX2navi's, Hookshot's and anything built under hookshot-wt/) or
#    /tmp, and that does not run inside the gate (the gate puts NX2NAVI_IN_GATE=<its process id> into the environment
#    of its command, which every child inherits; that process must be alive and hold the lock of one of the gate's
#    two slots, the files 0 and 1 of the slot folder: hold it, not only have the file open as every waiter has), is
#    killed and logged. The user's own programs and system tools (nvidia-smi, vulkaninfo, his games in
#    ~/Games/Ocarina, ~/Games/Ocarina-linux-next and ~/Games/Hookshot) are never touched.
#
# (2026-11-10, HsWorkbench: Hookshot's game copies, worktrees and clone added; the reports moved from NX2navi's
#    reports, now reference only, to Hookshot's /home/mooki/Code/hookshot-wt/reports: GUARD-TRIPPED.txt and lines in
#    LOG.md.)
# (2026-11-11, GateTwo: the gate has two slots; inside the gate is what holds slot 0's or slot 1's lock; a fault line
#    also puts the switch back to 1.)
#
# 3. A hold that lasts is said aloud. The rule is 8 minutes for one hold of the card; neither the gate nor this guard
#    ends a command for it. When the run that holds a slot (the gate's files holder.0 and holder.1 in the slot folder:
#    its process id, and the file's time is its start) has held it for more than 8 minutes, one line goes to
#    long-holds.log in the slot folder (time, pid, slot or slots, minutes, command), and again every 5 minutes while
#    it lasts. The main session's watchdog reads that file.
#
#   gpu-guard.sh            run in the foreground (the gate starts it detached)
#   gpu-guard.sh --status   say whether it runs and whether the card is closed
#   gpu-guard.sh --reopen   remove the "closed" file (main session, after telling the user what happened)
# NX2NAVI_GUARD_SOURCE=<file> makes it read that file's new lines instead of the kernel log (its own test); then
# NX2NAVI_GUARD_LONG="<s> <s>" sets the seconds before a hold's first line and between its lines (480 and 300).
