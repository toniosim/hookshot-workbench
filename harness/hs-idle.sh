# hs-idle.sh <command> [args...] : runs a CPU-only job (the game-free checks, tests/run_all.py; a sanitizer test) in the
# idle scheduling class, in one of three test slots. Like a build (hs-build-slot) it does not start once an
# exclusive GPU timing run's turn has come (the quiet-wanted mark of hs-gpu-slot --exclusive), and it holds the
# quiet lock shared while it runs, so a frame-rate measurement never has the checks beside it: an idle-class job still
# takes the second thread of a core the game runs on. It takes no build slot. Written 2026-11-10, when six runs of the
# checks beside four builds put the load at 170 during timing holds.

# GCC 13 (which has them) while that is so; `sudo apt install libstdc++-14-dev` makes this step do nothing.
