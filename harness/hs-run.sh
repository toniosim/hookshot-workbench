# One unattended Hookshot or Longshot run on the RTX 4090 (or, with --intel, the Intel UHD 770), through its gate. Written
# 2026-11-10 (HsWorkbench); --window 2026-11-11 (WindowRuns).
#
# THIS MACHINE (tonesi, 2026-11-11): RTX 3070 Ti (8 GB, also the COSMIC desktop's card), Intel UHD 770 beside it,
# i7-12700K, 16 GB of RAM. Where the text below says "RTX 4090" read "RTX 3070 Ti" (the summary checks for it). The gate
# lets one game in at a time here. --window on COSMIC: there is no window-rule interface like Hyprland's, so the game
# opens an ordinary window on the desktop (it may take the focus) and nothing watches it (window=unmanaged); still only
# while window-ok exists, and only when you are at the PC. --intel gets --mem-max 9G unless one is given (Intel's
# driver took 23-28 GB preparing shaders on the original machine; this one has 16 GB).
#

#   <tag>       the run's name: everything goes to <copy>/runs/<tag>/ (replaced if it exists)
#   <seconds>   wall time from the game's start; then SIGTERM (SIGKILL 20 s later). Exit 124 = ended at the wall
#   --window    a real window on the user's Hyprland instead of a headless run: for what needs a swapchain and the
#               compositor (presentation, frame pacing, V-Sync, frame generation's output, the window's title). ONLY
#               while the file /home/tonesi/Games/.hookshot-harness/window-ok exists (the user's switch: the main
#               session creates it while he is away and removes it when he is back); see "With --window" below.
#               Not with --intel, --prepare or HOS_HEADLESS
#   --exclusive the gate's exclusive hold (no build beside it, no other game on the card): for frame-rate measurements only
#   --whole     the whole card for this run (both of the gate's slots: no other game beside it), without stopping the
#               builds. Added by itself when the run's picture is larger than the game's own 2048x1152 (see
#               picture_large below); ask for it when a run needs the card's memory for another reason
#   --priority  the gate serves this run before the waiters that asked without it. ONLY for runs the main session has
#               named (the co-op and randomizer lanes' short runs, the performance holds): never to jump a queue
#   --intel     the Intel device instead: its gate (hs-intel-slot), Mesa's ICD only (intel_icd.json) and
#               RX_VK_DEVICE=0 = the UHD 770; the kernel count is then i915/xe hang, reset and error lines
#   --from <s>  frame statistics only from <s> seconds after the first present on (skip title, load, warm-up)
#   --input     HOS_INPUT_SCRIPT, e.g. '20:A,25:A,30:PLUS' (docs/development.md: Input for scripted runs); with it
#               HOS_INPUT_EXCLUSIVE=1, so only the script drives the game
#   --user      the save folder to start from (either game's --user folder: save/<user id>/...); copied, never used in
#               place. Default: <copy>/user-template if it exists, else an empty folder (a fresh profile)
#   --keep-user keep the run's throw-away user folder (default: only its save/ is kept, for a look afterwards)
#   --prepare   run the detected executable with --prepare-shaders (what a build's last step and a first start do:
#               the shader list translated and the shipped pipelines built, into the copy's caches), same environment
#   --mem-max <v> the game in a transient systemd user scope with MemoryMax=<v> and no swap (e.g. 28G): the kernel
#               ends it there instead of the machine running out (Intel's driver took 23-28 GB preparing shaders,
#               issues 999/1001/775)
#   --perf      optional sampled system context in runs/<tag>/perf.csv; no change to summary statistics
#               (older builds may write no file). Uses the run folder and all fields, after NAME=VALUE.
#   NAME=VALUE  more of the game's switches for this run (over the defaults below)
#
# The run: headless (HOS_HEADLESS=1: no window, no Wayland or X11 connection: WAYLAND_DISPLAY and DISPLAY unset),
# muted (HOS_AUDIO=0, SDL's dummy sound driver), NVIDIA's Vulkan driver only (VK_DRIVER_FILES) and RX_VK_DEVICE=0 =
# the RTX 4090 (the log's device list is checked after the run), no update check, no Discord status, no physical
# controller in the background, an empty HOS_ENV_FILE (the copy's hookshot_env.txt/longshot_env.txt is not read). The driver's
# shader caches stay in the copy (.nv-cache, .mesa-cache, .xdg-cache), XDG_DATA_HOME is the run's folder: nothing is
# written to the user's ~/.local/share, ~/.cache or ~/.config. Pictures every RX_VK_SHOT_EVERY presents (300) at
# 1280x720 into runs/<tag>/shots, the log into runs/<tag>/<project>_log.txt, and every game present's time into
# runs/<tag>/present.csv (HOS_PRESENT_TRACE, host/nn_vi.c: the game's own presents, frame limiter included, CPU
# clock). A populated RX_VK_FRAME_LOG (runs/<tag>/frames.csv) supplies renderer intervals: headless-renderer after
# offscreen submission, or swapchain with --window. Otherwise present.csv supplies game intervals (three or seven columns).
#
# With --window (the user's word of 2026-11-11, for exactly this): inside the gate, right before the game starts,
# hs-window.py finds the one live Hyprland and sends it two window rules for the class hookshot-harness (never
# focused, floating at the monitor's size on the visible workspace, the game's requests for fullscreen, maximize and
# activation ignored); the game starts only if the compositor answers `ok` to both, with SDL_APP_ID=hookshot-harness
# (SDL then names the window so: reports/WindowRuns.md), on Wayland only (DISPLAY unset), still muted. The window
# covers the monitor (1536x864 logical = 1920x1080 pixels at his scale of 1.25) and cannot be focused: keys, mouse
# and controllers do not reach it; HOS_INPUT_SCRIPT and HOS_INPUT_LIVE do. While it runs hs-window.py reads the
# clients and the active window and ends the run at once if the window has another class, is not floating, is
# fullscreen, is on another workspace or has the focus (runs/<tag>/window-problem.txt). The active window and the
# clients before and after are in runs/<tag>/window-before.json and window-after.json, the rules and their answers in
# window-rules.txt. One windowed run at a time (window.lock). RX_VK_FRAME_LOG is written now, so the frame
# statistics are the swapchain's presents (generated frames included) and game= is the game's own rate from
# present.csv over the same last seconds (the two files end together but start apart: the renderer's first present
# is the start-up screen's, the game's comes some seconds later, 8.8 s in the first run). The window is asked for at
# the monitor's logical size (SDL takes HOS_WINDOW_SIZE in logical units on Wayland: 1920x1080 gave a first swapchain
# of 2400x1350 that the rule then shrank). The summary adds: swapchain=<size>,<present mode>,vsync-<row>,x<times made>, game=<fps>, and
# hs-window.py's line (window=ok|none|PROBLEM(...) class= size= at= ws= float= active=same|CHANGED others=same
# screen=on|LOCKED(k/n)|BLANKED(k/n)). A run whose window= is not ok or whose active= is not same is disturbed: tell
# the main session. A run whose screen= is not on was not composited the whole time: its frame log is not a
# presentation measurement (no run starts with the screen locked or the monitor off; nothing ever wakes or unlocks it).
# The switch is read when the run is asked and again when its turn comes; a run in progress finishes when it goes.
#
# Prints one line (also runs/<tag>/summary.txt and appended to /home/tonesi/Games/.hookshot-harness/runs.log):
#   exit, wall seconds, span (seconds from the first present to the last), frames (and their source), mean fps and 1%
#   low fps (1000 / the mean of the slowest 1% frame times), frames over 16.7, 20 and 25 ms (at the 60 cap the game's
#   intervals scatter around 16.67 ms, so over16.7 counts about half of them; over20 is the dropped-frame count), pictures (count, size of one,
#   MB), FATAL, CRASH, device-lost and "ran without a core" lines in the log, driver lines from start through end
#   (kernel=: faults/unknown signatures, or Intel hang/reset/error lines; nvrm=: every NVRM line, repeats included),
#   device and load average before/after. journal=complete|unknown records coverage; failed/partial reads print
#   kernel=unknown nvrm=unknown, with the journal receipt in kernel-status.json and retained lines in kernel.txt.
