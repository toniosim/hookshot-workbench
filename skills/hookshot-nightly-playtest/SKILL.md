# Hookshot nightly playtest

The public tool is `/home/mooki/Games/.hookshot-harness/nightly/`. Its private input and output are
`/home/mooki/Games/.hookshot-harness/nightly-local/`. The code and this skill contain the method, never a route,
place, save, game value, or a private dump path. **Neither the local folder nor the save library is published.**

## Status and limits

**Current scope, 2026-11-11, the user's main session:** the ordinary catalogue night remains paused, but a rolling
test of new main builds is authorized below. The optional nightly timer remains disabled until the user asks.

Source builds, the project game-free suite and the tool's game-free tests have run; no rolling GPU cycle has run yet.
The suite's named result and its earlier player-protection stop are retained privately. Offline stand-ins are not
game results. The rolling comparisons have been checked on made-up numbers against the shared regression rules.

Implementation also exists for catalogue scenarios, the control runner, trace/resource/log/image collection, SQLite
metrics, confirmation reruns, issue drafts and the shared hunt handoff. The catalogue-driven game-facing paths are
not live-validated, and no catalogue gameplay baseline or picture proof exists.

The initial local definitions cover catalogue loads with standing/movement/camera steps, two title starts, a video
sequence and a second-GPU scene. The catalogue supplies all actual saves and places. Those definitions remain unrun.

Designed but **not implemented as complete scenario families**: exhaustive teleport destinations; every available
Insert setting/value including restart-required rows, upscalers, output sizes and frame caps; game-owned save/write
and reload cycles; continuous long-duration memory-growth runs; intentional simultaneous build load; empty-cache
and two-game stress. Generic individual teleport and option round-trip steps are implemented, but are not evidence
that an exhaustive sweep ran. A permitted window scenario is supported by the runner but not in the initial plan.
The runner currently rejects runs longer than 450 seconds (reserving termination time inside eight minutes) even though the approved future long-run design below
allows them. Do not relabel short samples as a 30-minute leak test.

**Earlier bounded-run design approval: 2026-11-11, the user's main session. These limits are not permission to run tonight:**
- Only 02:00–07:00: two separate 30-minute holds, standing then area changes, ordinary queue, one slot each; no
  `--whole`, `--exclusive` or `--priority`. Never start the second after a fault in the first. Log each to the gate's
  `long-holds.log`; stop on watchdog conditions or the user's play-folder game. These long holds are designed, not built.
- One windowed run of at most two minutes per night, only while the harness's `window-ok` exists, never focused,
  obeying the workbench's window guard. No compositor commands of the nightly tool's own.
- One two-game stress hold per night, at most eight minutes: the second starts only after the first has run a minute,
  at least 12 GB of GPU memory is free and at least 30 GB of system memory is available. This family is designed, not built.
- Outside 02:00–07:00 every hold is at most eight minutes. The optional timer is off by default and requires the
  user's explicit word. Those longer-run families remain design-only; rolling has its separate short-hold budget.

The nightly grants itself no quiet-measurement authorization. `gpu_scenarios_enabled` and `timer_enabled` remain
false for ordinary nights; the user's explicit rolling authorization is recorded separately in `rolling.json`.

## Rolling test of each new main

This mode is the ongoing performance tester requested by the user. It reuses the full nightly builder and
`regress/run_case.py` with local scenes supplied by the regression investigator; it does not create a second
measurement or bisect implementation.

```sh
H=/home/mooki/Games/.hookshot-harness
P=$(jq -r .python "$H/nightly-local/config.json")
"$P" -I -B "$H/nightly/hs-nightly.py" rolling
"$P" -I -B "$H/nightly/hs-nightly.py" rolling --check
"$P" -I -B "$H/nightly/hs-nightly.py" rolling --watch
```

The first command is a manually requested cycle. `--check` is **not read-only**: it starts a cycle when main has
moved and at least three hours have passed since the preceding cycle's start. `--watch` is the same check every
five minutes, as a managed long-running command while the agent runs, **not a timer or unit file**. It stops on a
confirmed regression or a safety/build failure. Do not launch an unmanaged background shell. A shared lock prevents
overlap with an ordinary night. No watcher or timer is started merely by installing the tool.

One cycle fetches `origin/main` once and pins its head. The same head as the last completed cycle writes
`unchanged` and stops without a build or a GPU request. Otherwise it uses the full workbench build path and lock,
records both the builder's duration and elapsed time including its gate wait, and creates an owned reflink copy.
Identical opt-in logging aids are recorded separately from the pinned upstream commit; an already accepted local
SDK may be reused, but the tool accepts no license or download prompt.

**Authorized GPU cost per cycle:** one ordinary shader-preparation hold, one ordinary unmeasured warm-up hold for
the new build's scene/mode definitions, then at most three exclusive measuring holds, each at most eight minutes,
**never `--priority`**. The regression investigator's priority holds go first. Each measured scene runs
new / previous / new / previous in its own hold. The first previous build is an owned, hash-checked reflink of the
configured reference; the supplied reference folder itself is never run or changed. Later cycles compare with the
previous completed cycle's build. A conservative source-compatibility check permits warmed-cache reuse; when cached
preparation and all warm-ups fit, they share one ordinary hold. Warm-up values are never reported as measurements.
Every report states actual GPU gate occupancy per build; unavailable hold durations stay unavailable, not zero.

The player-folder rule applies to the whole cycle and every gate wait. Two continuously observed player-idle minutes
are required before work starts; a game appearing there stops owned work, with incomplete runs excluded. A disturbed
or invalid hold is retained, never silently replaced by a favorable sample or repeated outside the approved budget.

The quiet rule is the regression tool's: everything except the game uses **under three cores on average**, no
five-second sample exceeds **six cores**, and each judged arm repeats within **5%**. One-minute load averages remain
in the table but do not substitute for these counters. Both pairs must point the same way, their ranges must not
overlap, and the smallest paired gap must exceed the sum of the two arms' repeat ranges; the shared paired
classifier must confirm the bad band. The local scene names its judged metric. Other columns support the diagnosis,
not independent unconfirmed regression claims.

Each scene table shows fps, mean frame ms, 1% low, frames over 20/25 ms, all-thread game CPU ms/frame from the shared
adapter, readback wait/frame, peak RSS, competing CPU use, loads and whether each run counts. Fixed reference rows
retain their actual measurement dates and are not rerun every cycle; a reference not yet built/measured says so.
Source-stamp checks are per arm. A confirmed range is handed to `regress.py` with its real scene and observed bands;
the tool stops and **starts no hunt**. Hunt endpoints carry `regress-source.txt`, and the shared source-aware build/run
adapters validate each midpoint against its own stamp. An older shared adapter must be upgraded before that handoff
is used.

All definitions, references, results and reports are private under `nightly-local/rolling/`; measurements also enter
the existing results database. Raw/copies retain seven calendar dates, while dated fixed-reference values persist.
`--resume-cycle ID` reuses a completed build and completed holds; it never queues a duplicate or exceeds the hold
budget. Reports go to the user through the main session. The tool **posts nothing and has no timer**.

Game-free rolling checks (the shared regression tools must provide the current quiet/repeat API):

```sh
"$H/hs-nocore.sh" "$P" -I -B "$H/nightly/test_rolling.py" -v
```

## Run a night

Use the configured workbench Python, not an arbitrary system Python. The configuration is local:

```sh
H=/home/mooki/Games/.hookshot-harness
P=$(jq -r .python "$H/nightly-local/config.json")
"$P" -I -B "$H/nightly/hs-nightly.py" run --game-free
```

One lock covers the night; a second invocation exits without a build or a game. A night resolves the `nightly` tag
once using the published release and a tag fetch, records the exact commit, and never substitutes moving main.
It builds through the full-build lock and build gate, eight lift workers and the configured compile workers,
`--no-prepare-shaders`, then makes an owned reflink snapshot. The stable build workspace preserves cache identity.
Build logs, elapsed duration including queue wait, the builder's own duration line, warning lines, hashes and sizes
are kept. **Upstream suppresses compiler warnings; zero logged warnings is not a warning-clean build.**

The selected commit's `tests/run_all.py` runs through `hs-idle.sh`, the pinned Python and `-I -B`. Named passes,
failures, skips and durations are compared with the preceding night. New failures and vanished names are distinct;
slow tests under load are observations, not performance regressions. Existing machine failures remain visible.

The game-free mode never launches a scenario or timer. With `gpu_scenarios_enabled` false, plain `run` also remains
game-free. The game-facing behavior below describes implemented code, **not live-validated behavior**.

Each scenario gets a fresh save copy from `hs-save.sh`, and `hs-run.sh` makes the played copy again. No library save
is modified. The selected commit's `scripts/hookshot_ctl.py` supplies the bridge; there is no second protocol client.
Waiting in the GPU queue does not consume the scenario's play deadline. A load requires the game-reported map,
expected map when specified, play state, loading false and no event unless explicitly allowed: a title movie with
many draws does not count as play. All actions and replies are retained. Inputs are exclusive, timed in game frames.

A safety monitor and the shared watchdog cover builds, the suite and scenario execution. Memory available, swap free
and PSI limits come from private configuration; unreadable safety data fails closed. Driver faults/unknown NVIDIA
lines, a closed gate, missing compositor, or the protected play-folder game stop work. Expected allocation/mapping
refusals follow the brief and are retained. A new core from another process can stop the watchdog too; that does not
prove this game caused it.

**The player wins, always:** a game whose executable or working folder is in the play folder means the player is
playing. No nightly GPU scenario starts. A running scenario is asked to quit over a separate control connection,
with bounded termination fallback, marked cut short and excluded from baselines and regression decisions. Resume
only after the tool has observed no such process for two continuous minutes; a new appearance resets that clock.
The stop during the actual suite exercised detection and cancellation; clean in-game shutdown is tested with a
stand-in only. Never touch or stop the player's process.

`run --resume --night ID --game-free` continues an interrupted night. It reuses its exact completed build, a complete
stored suite, and completed scenarios; it archives interrupted attempts before retrying incomplete work.
`--resume-build --night ID` instead starts a new database night from an already completed build. Inspect `state.json`
and preserved evidence after interruptions; never overwrite an earlier attempt or rerun successful setup.

## Read a report

`nightly-local/reports/<date>.md` begins with State and says what ran, which commit, outcomes, durations, known test
failures, findings, improvements and what could not be judged. `state.json` points at it. Evidence is under
`nightly-local/raw/<date>/`; the played run files are in the owned snapshot named by `build.json`.

- `results.sqlite`: one `metrics` row per night/scenario/metric; scenario JSON, findings and named test results are
  preserved too. A confirmation rerun has separate raw evidence and cannot replace the first sample.
- `baselines/latest.json`: up to seven accepted matching-scenario records. One good night seeds it; three are needed
  for a numeric or picture band. Changed steps/settings change the scenario fingerprint and start a new baseline.
- Both `frames.csv` and `present.csv` are read separately. The game's trace can be restricted to loaded play; the
  renderer's trace has its own zero and is reported over its whole run. Headless renderer intervals describe CPU
  offscreen submits, **not GPU completion or scanout**. No trace is silently replaced by another.
- Metrics include mean/median interval, mean fps, 1% and 0.1% low (1000 divided by the mean of the slowest fraction),
  count and longest frame strictly over 16.7/25/50/100 ms, and the fewest completions in a rolling second. At a 60 cap,
  16.7 ms is sensitive to ordinary pacing jitter; it is not automatically a visible hitch.
- Process RSS, CPU seconds, device-wide and available per-process GPU memory are sampled. Peaks and least-squares
  slopes use active-game samples only. Global GPU memory is not the game's own allocation. Missing process accounting
  stays missing, not zero. Short-run slopes include startup effects and are not evidence of a leak.
- Warnings/errors retain every original line and a normalized signature/count. Shader/pipeline activity in play is
  aligned with nearby present hitches using log-read receipt time, with up to two seconds of alignment uncertainty;
  proximity is not causation. Core info and an all-thread GDB backtrace are kept when a matching core is available;
  unavailable symbols are not invented. No core is exported or published.
- Fixed-event images use blurred 64x36 RGB features and normalized RMS distance to the last good night's image.
  Tolerance comes from the pairwise distances across 3–7 good nights. `black` means all reduced luminance <=2/255;
  `blank` means luminance range <=2/255. A short capture burst with a middle luminance reversal >=40/255 and endpoints
  within 5/255 is a **flash candidate**, not proof; sparse capture can miss flashes. These diagnostic limits are not
  empirical regression bands. Look at every cited image before publishing, including every candidate.

## What the bands mean

For the last 3–7 accepted values, center = median. Half-width = max(observed maximum absolute deviation,
3 × 1.4826 × median absolute deviation). The metric's variation, not a guessed percentage, sets the band. A perfectly
constant history has zero width; a timing/memory outlier still requires one independent rerun beyond that same band.
There is no regression claim from the first night.

An ordinary gate run is always marked timing-disturbed, even if its sampled load happens to look low. Compilers,
other games and load are also recorded. Disturbed timing/memory values cannot populate their numeric baseline,
confirm an outlier, or establish an improvement. They still carry useful pass/fail, log, image and count evidence.
This initial nightly does **not** schedule exclusive timing holds; a dedicated approved quiet-run path is needed
before it can accumulate performance baselines. Never reinterpret tonight's raw frame numbers as benchmarks.

A previously passing scenario that fails, a new warning/error signature, a count beyond its empirical band, a crash,
or an image beyond historical tolerance creates a finding. First-night faults remain first observations, not a
fictional regression range. Tests for bands, disturbance exclusion and signatures use only made-up inputs:

```sh
"$H/hs-nocore.sh" "$P" -I -B "$H/nightly/test_compare.py" --mutations
```

The mutation mode proves the same tests fail when spread, disturbed-run exclusion, or signature normalization is
removed. It does not start a game, build a game, contact a service, or require a dump.

## Add a local scenario

Create one JSON file under `nightly-local/scenarios/`, never beside the public code. Fields: `schema_version: 1`,
unique safe `id`, `description`, optional catalogue `save`, `boot: continue|title`, `seconds` (20–450),
`boot_timeout`, optional `expected_map`, `settings` (environment names/values), `affected_paths`, `issue_query`, and
`steps`. `enabled: false` excludes it; `order` controls scheduling. `intel`, `window` and `whole` select the wrapper's
existing guarded modes. A window still needs its permission switch and <=120 seconds.

Operations: `wait` with seconds; `shot` with name; `burst` with name/count; `request` with a control request and
optional dotted-field `expect`; `assert_play`; `assert_log` with pattern/minimum; `press_until` with seconds,
buttons/every; `teleport` with destination and timeout; `options` with a map of row keys to ordered values. Options
are read, set through the menu setter, verified and restored. A failed/unreachable value fails the step. Do not use
a generic option sweep to enable a safety override, microphone, or higher output size without its required policy.

Catalogue scenarios are regenerated from `saves/catalogue.json` and the private `catalogue-template.json` each night.
New catalogue entries are therefore included automatically; existing hand-written files do not contain copied saves.
The library is the input, not a distributable artifact. Another tester obtains equivalent early saves by playing a
scripted new-game route on their own copy and storing its own saves, or by using the cleaned save maker with a local
names file and their own seed save. The maker edits a seed; it does not reconstruct another person's complete
progress or create a valid account from nothing. Proven and unproven routes must stay distinct in local notes.

## From finding to issue draft and hunt

The tool searches open issues and all-state pull requests before writing a local draft in the configured drafts
folder. It keeps search output, full commit subjects/PR numbers for last-good..tonight and the commits touching the
scenario's `affected_paths`. These are suspects by overlap, not proven causes. The game-problem form's headings are
used, with evidence paths and explicit unchecked publication prerequisites. It writes a 2–6-line Discord draft
beginning `Progress (mooki000's agent):`. **Nothing is posted, pushed, attached or shared automatically.**

Read `hookshot-issue-triage` and `hookshot-pr-evidence`; inspect matching issue threads, choose an existing issue
rather than a duplicate, choose severity × reach × confidence from evidence, review images and redact paths.
The first-run report can contain unresolved baseline failures without inventing a past good commit.

`hookshot-regression-hunt` owns bisection, equal-lift-input fast builds, revert suspects and endpoint decision rules.
The nightly emits `hunt-scenario.json` and `hunt-handoff.json` with the exact scenario/measure, good/bad commits and a
cap of 8 steps/90 minutes, and invokes the hunt's read-only `plan` when installed. It reuses the shared
`regress/build_case.py` and its own `hunt.py` held-control adapter, never a second build/bisect implementation.
Ordinary pass/fail hunts can run when private `hunt_game_checks` is enabled and four endpoint runs plus the shared
tool's 25-second per-run evidence reserve fit eight minutes. `hunt_seconds`, when specified in a local scenario,
must be a separately proven bound that still completes all its steps; do not shorten a test to fit.
Numeric hunts remain handoffs until specific quiet-hold authorization is given. Log/image findings need a
deterministic validator before they can decide a hunt. The shared result is included in the finding and draft;
unsupported or exhausted hunts say why they are inconclusive. The adapter is implemented but not yet exercised.

## Optional timer after reboot — disabled

Do not arm it until the user explicitly asks. Only then enable private `timer_enabled`, and only after a clean full
night (a game-free-only result is not a clean full night):

```sh
"$P" -I -B "$H/nightly/hs-nightly.py" arm --user-authorized
```

The omitted `--at` computes tomorrow's explicit calendar date with `date`; an explicit systemd calendar date can be
supplied instead. `systemd-run --user --on-calendar=...` creates no unit file and touches nothing in `~/.config`.
After that explicit opt-in the transient service uses `run --rearm`; only a clean full completion arms another
night. Failure or game-free-only completion stops the chain. The lock prevents overlap. `timer.json` records the
calendar, unit and command. A reboot removes transient units; re-arming still requires the user's authorization.
No timer has been armed or exercised by this lane.

## Public sync list

Publish only `nightly/hs-nightly.py`, `build.py`, `common.py`, `scenario.py`, `monitor.py`, `metrics.py`, `compare.py`,
`store.py`, `report.py`, `hunt.py`, `rolling.py`, `test_compare.py`, `test_driver.py`, `test_rolling.py`, `README.md`, and this skill's `SKILL.md`.
Never sync configuration, JSON scenarios, baselines, databases, raw runs, reports, drafts, images, saves, game copies,
caches or generated client data.
