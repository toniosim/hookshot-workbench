#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs the project's own checks (the Windows jobs included) on a commit BEFORE it reaches an upstream pull request, by
# way of a scratch draft pull request inside the user's fork. Use it for every commit that can behave differently on
# Windows: a new or changed C/C++ fixture, Python that touches files, paths, processes or locking, a workflow change.
#
#   hs-fork-ci.sh <commit> <label> [--keep] [--minutes N]
#
#   <commit>  what to check (a branch, a tag or a SHA of the current repository); it is pushed to the fork as
#             ci/<label>-<sha8> and nothing else is touched (never the fork's main: a push there can start its release
#             workflows; never the upstream branch)
#   <label>   a short name for the scratch branch and the draft's title: [a-z0-9-], e.g. pr2710 or pin-commit
#   --keep    leave the scratch draft and its branch (default: close the draft and delete the branch when the checks end)
#   --minutes how long to wait for the checks (default 30)
#
# Why a draft pull request and not a dispatch: the fork's main is far behind upstream, so its copy of the workflows has
# no dispatch trigger; a pull request inside the fork runs the workflows of the commit under test.
# Exit 0: every "Python source checks (windows-2022 ...)" job passed and no other job failed. Exit 1: a Windows job
# failed or is missing. Exit 2: only non-Windows jobs failed (read them: the fork's AppImage job can fail at a download,
# which says nothing about the commit). Exit 3: timed out. Prints one line per job either way.
# It uses the gh command the user is signed in with and reads no token itself.
